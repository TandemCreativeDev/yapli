# Security Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Overall, the codebase demonstrates **good security practices** with proper use of Prisma ORM, NextAuth.js, and modern React patterns. However, there are several **critical security vulnerabilities** that need immediate attention, particularly around authorization controls and input validation.

## üö® Critical Security Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. **Missing Authorization in Messages API** 
**Severity: CRITICAL**
- **File:** `src/app/api/rooms/[roomId]/messages/route.ts`
- **Issue:** No authentication or authorization checks for both GET and POST endpoints
- **Impact:** Anyone can read messages from any chatroom and post messages without authentication
- **Lines:** All endpoints (17-94)
- **Recommendation:** Add session validation and room access controls

### 2. **Public Chatroom Access**
**Severity: HIGH**
- **File:** `src/app/api/rooms/[roomId]/route.ts`
- **Issue:** GET endpoint allows anyone to view chatroom details without authentication
- **Impact:** Information disclosure of chatroom metadata
- **Lines:** 7-56
- **Recommendation:** Add authentication check or implement proper access controls

### 3. **Link Preview SSRF Vulnerability**
**Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH**
- **File:** `src/app/api/link-preview/route.ts`
- **Issue:** Incomplete SSRF protection - only blocks localhost and common private ranges
- **Lines:** 26-43
- **Missing protections:**
  - IPv6 localhost (::1)
  - Link-local addresses (169.254.x.x, fe80::/10)
  - Loopback interfaces (127.x.x.x range)
  - Cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254)
- **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive IP range validation

### 4. **Weak Password Policy**
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- **Files:** 
  - `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` (line 17)
  - `src/app/auth/register/page.tsx` (line 31)
- **Issue:** Minimum password length of only 6 characters
- **Recommendation:** Increase to at least 8 characters and add complexity requirements

## ‚úÖ Security Strengths

### SQL Injection Protection
- **Excellent use of Prisma ORM** throughout the codebase
- No raw SQL queries detected
- All database interactions use parameterized queries via Prisma
- Strong type safety with TypeScript

### XSS Protection
- No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` found
- Proper use of React's built-in XSS protection
- Safe URL handling with `linkify-react` library
- Input sanitization with `.trim()` methods

### Authentication Implementation
- **Solid NextAuth.js setup** with multiple providers (credentials, Google, GitHub)
- Proper password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds of 12
- Secure session management with JWT strategy
- Protected routes with proper session validation

### Input Validation
- Client-side validation with `maxLength` attributes
- Server-side validation for required fields
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## üîß Moderate Security Concerns

### 1. **No Rate Limiting**
- **Impact:** Susceptible to brute force attacks and API abuse
- **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints and message creation

### 2. **Socket.IO Security**
- **File:** `server.js`
- **Issue:** Limited input validation on socket events
- **Lines:** 86-98 (send-message handler)
- **Recommendation:** Add comprehensive validation for all socket events

### 3. **CORS Configuration**
- **File:** `server.js` (lines 26-30)
- **Issue:** CORS disabled in production (`origin: false`)
- **Recommendation:** Configure specific allowed origins for production

### 4. **Error Information Disclosure**
- **Files:** Multiple API routes
- **Issue:** Some error messages may leak internal information
- **Example:** Direct bcrypt errors, Prisma errors
- **Recommendation:** Implement generic error responses for production

## üìù Low-Risk Observations

### Environment Variables
- Proper use of `process.env` for sensitive configuration
- No hardcoded secrets found in the codebase
- OAuth credentials properly externalized

### File Upload Security
- No file upload functionality detected (good for attack surface reduction)

### Data Exposure
- Passwords properly excluded from API responses
- Sensitive user data handled appropriately

## üéØ Recommendations by Priority

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Add authentication to messages API endpoints**
2. **Implement proper authorization for chatroom access**
3. **Enhance SSRF protection in link preview**

### High Priority
1. Implement rate limiting across all API endpoints
2. Strengthen password policy (8+ characters, complexity requirements)
3. Add comprehensive input validation to Socket.IO events
4. Configure proper CORS for production

### Medium Priority
1. Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations
2. Add request logging and monitoring
3. Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
4. Add input length limits and validation for all user inputs

### Long-term
1. Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP)
2. Add security headers middleware
3. Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
4. Consider adding two-factor authentication

## üèÅ Conclusion

The codebase follows many security best practices, particularly around SQL injection prevention and XSS protection. However, the **critical authorization gaps in the messages API** represent significant security risks that should be addressed immediately. The authentication system is well-implemented, but needs to be consistently applied across all protected resources.

Focus on implementing proper authorization controls first, then address the input validation and rate limiting concerns to significantly improve the application's security posture.
