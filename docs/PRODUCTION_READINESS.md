# Production Readiness Checklist

## Current Stack

- NGINX for reverse proxy and TLS termination
- Next.js for frontend and API routes
- Prisma ORM for database interactions
- WebSocket server for real-time communications
- PostgreSQL database for data persistence

## Critical Infrastructure Gaps

### Caching & Session Management

- **Redis/caching layer** - Essential for session storage, rate limiting, and performance
- **Session persistence** - How are user sessions maintained across server restarts?

### File Storage & Assets

- **File storage strategy** - Where do uploads/assets go? S3, local volumes, or CDN?
- **Static asset optimization** - Should NGINX serve static files directly?
- **Image processing** - How are uploaded images resized/optimized?

### Configuration Management

- **Environment management** - How are secrets/configs handled across environments?
- **Secret management** - Database credentials, API keys, JWT secrets
- **Configuration validation** - Startup checks for required environment variables

### Database Operations

- **Database migrations** - How does Prisma handle schema changes in production?
- **Connection pooling** - PgBouncer or similar for connection management
- **Database backups** - Automated backup strategy and disaster recovery
- **Query optimization** - Database indexing and performance monitoring

### Service Health & Monitoring

- **Health checks** - How does NGINX know if services are healthy?
- **Service discovery** - How do services find each other?
- **Graceful shutdowns** - Proper cleanup on service restart/deployment

### Logging & Observability

- **Centralized logging** - Structured logging across all services
- **Error tracking** - Exception monitoring and alerting
- **Performance monitoring** - Response times, database queries, memory usage
- **Request tracing** - End-to-end request tracking across services

### Security Implementation

- **CORS configuration** - Frontend-API communication policies
- **Rate limiting** - Where and how is this enforced (NGINX vs application level)?
- **Input validation** - API request validation and sanitization
- **SQL injection prevention** - Prisma parameterized queries verification
- **XSS protection** - Content Security Policy headers

### Scalability Concerns

- **WebSocket scaling** - How do WebSockets work across multiple instances?
- **Load balancing** - NGINX upstream configuration for multiple API instances
- **Database scaling** - Read replicas, connection limits
- **Horizontal scaling** - Container orchestration strategy

### Deployment Infrastructure

- **Container orchestration** - Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or manual containers?
- **Blue-green deployments** - Zero-downtime deployment strategy
- **Rollback procedures** - How to quickly revert problematic deployments
- **Environment parity** - Development/staging/production consistency

### Business Continuity

- **Disaster recovery** - RTO/RPO requirements and procedures
- **Data retention policies** - How long is data kept?
- **Compliance requirements** - GDPR, data protection regulations
- **Performance SLAs** - Uptime and response time targets

## Priority Assessment

**Critical (blocks production):**

- Redis for session management
- Database backup strategy
- Environment/secret management
- Health checks and monitoring

**High (impacts reliability):**

- Centralized logging
- Rate limiting implementation
- Database connection pooling
- CORS configuration

**Medium (improves operations):**

- File storage strategy
- Container orchestration
- Performance monitoring
- Graceful shutdowns

**Low (nice to have):**

- Blue-green deployments
- Advanced observability
- Compliance tooling
