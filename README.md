## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- OAuth app credentials (Google and/or GitHub - optional)

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/yapli"

NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"

GITHUB_ID="your-github-client-id"
GITHUB_SECRET="your-github-client-secret"
```

### Installation & Development

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up the database:**

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
